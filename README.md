# UFO Sightings Webpage Update
## Purpose
The purpose of the website is to allow a user to filter through UFO sighting data by various filters. It allows a user to search the data by 5 criteria (using one or all five search options).

## Results
The webpage initially loads the entire data table, with 5 search boxes on the left hand side, as shown in the image below.

To search the user enters a search criterion and presses enter. Once done, the table adjusts for the search results. A user can enter one search item as seen below:

Or multple search items:

## Summary

while the website currently performs its purpose, there are a few ways to improve it. A current challenge of the webpage is that once a search is performed and filtered, in order to return to the original table, you need to refresh the page.

I would add drop-down menus to the search criteria to help users when they don't know the exact name, place they want to search. In addition, I'd add a reset button that refreshes the page and clears the search criteria. Finally, I would add a map, that shows the location of all the UFO sightings, and allow the user to hover over the map points to see the associated data.
